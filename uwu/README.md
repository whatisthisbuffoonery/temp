## ft\_printf  
  
*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by dthoo.*  
  
### Description  
This project aims to emulate the printf function from \<stdio.h\>.  
  
###### Format string syntax: ...%\<flags\>\<width\>.\<precision\>\<type\>...  
  
#### Supported types are:  
	- c		\(char\)  
	- s		\(string\)  
	- p		\(pointer value\)  
	- d, i	\(signed integers\)  
	- u		\(unsigned integer\)  
	- x, X	\(hex numbers, in lower or uppercase\)  
	- %		\(literal percent sign\)  
  
#### Width and precision:  
	- width means the minimum string length that an item should take up  
		-	if the argument is shorter in length than the given width \(0 if unset\), it is padded with trailing spaces to meet the minimum length  
	- precision:  
		-	for numbers \(decimal or hex\), it means the minimum number of digits it should take up. Leading zeros are used to pad if needed  
		-	for strings, it means the maximum number of characters to print.  
			-		for "\(null\)", nothing is printed when precision is set and below 6 \("%s", NULL\)  
  
#### Supported flags are:  
	- 0		\(fills width space with 0s instead of spaces\)  
	- \-		(left justifies content, instead of the default right justify\)  
	- \#		alternate hex form \(just puts a prefix, really\)  
	- ' '		uses a leading space to indicate a positive decimal number \(including 0\)  
	- \+		overrides the space flag to use a \+ to indicate a positive number  
  
#### Duplicate flags are tolerated  
  
#### Caveats:  
	- using the space flag and setting width is not a good idea. It might as well be a conflict but, as with the standard printf, it is not  
	- the built\-in printf enjoys many benefits from being a special function that receives extra care from the compiler. It can detect:  
		-	an improper amount of arguments for a given format string  
		-	type mismatches  
		-	the original base system \(decimal, octal, hex\) of a number \(not in string format\) to be considered when parsing %i  
		-	conflicting flags  
		-	conflicting flags and types  
	- we the programmer cannot hope to do most of these items within the pace 8 deadline.  
	- to implement error highlighting for flags would be inconsistent with the rest of the caveats, where we cannot do much  
	- instead, we ignore flags and try to print the string anyway:  
  
##### Ignoring stuff  
	- \#:			if the type is anything besides x or X, this is ignored  
	- ' ':		if \+ is specified, ignore this flag  
	- \+:			if the arg is not a signed number, both \+ and ' ' would be ignored  
	- 0:			if precision is set, or if \- is specified, or if the arg is not a number, ignore this flag  
	- precision:	for %c and %p, ignore this value  
  
### Instructions  
  
To compile: make && clang \-Wall \-Wextra \-Werror main.c libftprintf.a  
  
Other make rules:  
	- bonus, clean, fclean, re  
  
### Resources  
  
Honestly, asking AI about the flags was a mistake. I have been discovering quirks and interactions up until the last second  
The very best resource covering these details is the man page `man 3 printf`  
Alternatively, `https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html`  
  
Claude did help troubleshoot my veriadic logic not functioning properly on mobile terminals:  
	- on wsl and on campus, passing around the va\_list by value worked fine  
	- however, on my phone \(Termux\) and ipad \(iSH\), they needed the va\_list to be passed via pointer when helper functions were involved  
		-	or else they would process the first arg over and over  
		-	affected calls: process\(q, &va, &return\_value\), va\_arg\(\*va, ...\)

### Technical choices  
  
#### Data structure of choice  
  
Repeatedly handling array index positions is something to be despised above all else  
So, I have made the following adjustments:  
	- designing a system where the format string is iterated over only twice  
	- separating my validation, parsing, and flag ignoring logic  
	- offloading index adjustments to other functions where suitable  
  
To do all this, I chose to use a linked list to hold all the args and flags  
  
#### Character matching convenience  
  
There are two tables for matching flags and type identifiers, flag and type respectively  
	- flag is used for validating the format string, and never again  
	- type\_bus uses type to scan for individual flag matches without going past the type specifier  
	- neither of these tables make it to process. They are not needed anymore  
  
#### Type\_bus flag setting  
  
I had to stop the function from reacting to the 0 flag  
The condition for breaking out checks for a \>= 1 && a \<= 9  
  
#### Filling width and precision fields  
  
All argument strings are handled by handle\_flag, which returns a malloc'd string with necessary filler placed, and index placed to fill the correct places with content after  
First, the string length is calculated from max\(width, precision, size\)  
	- size is passed in from the caller, which would be the number of digits or characters that would be printed from the format argument  
	- precision is modified by both caller and callee:  
		-	for numbers, precision should not consider prefixes for padding leading 0s  
		-	for strings, precision is reduced to size if larger  
	- for chars and pointer values, precision is disregarded  
	- max\(width, precision, size\) is saved as len  
  
Then, the string is initialised to hold '0' in all spaces  
	- for non\-numbers, precision would be equal to or smaller than size, and this has no effect  
	- for numbers, remaining 0s would be visible  
  
Width is then considered to fill the spaces that precision and size do not occupy  
	- if the 0 flag is in effect, we do not have to do anything  
	- remaining spaces are calulated with start and end bounds  
		-	for left\-justify, start: max\(size, precision\), end: width  
		-	for right\-justify, start: 0, end: width \- max\(size, precision\)  
  
Index is set according to the following:  
	- for left\-justify, precision \- size  
	- for right\-justify, max\(width, precision\) \- size  
	- if i is a negative number \(i.e. size was the bigger part of the equation\), i is set to 0  
  
#### Argument handling  
  
Grab takes an argument according to the type specifier. And so, that is how I split up my argument operations  
    - %c takes an int out of the list, as calling va\_arg\(va, char\) leads to undefined behaviour  
    - including larger-than-needed containers in the prototypes of my functions causes printing discrepancies with the standard printf, so I have not  
    	-	for uint\_op, container over/underflow happens either at:  
    		-		va\_arg\(\*va, unsigned int\) in grab  
    		-		or, return \(uint\_op\(\(unsigned long\) src, type, q\)\) in ptr\_op  
		-	for int\_op, container over/underflow happens at the grab call:  
			-		va\_arg\(\*va, int\)
  
#### On handling int\_max, int\_min, long\_max, long\_min, uint\_max, and ulong\_max  
  
I use an iterator t to traverse my number. I always use the same type for t that I do for my number.  
	- for %d and %i, I pass my arg into an unsigned int before working on it  
	- for hex numbers and %u, I use unsigned longs  
  
t increments via: t \*= base  
For a number n, t stops at \(n / t\) \<= base  
  
For positive values:  
	- t is guaranteed to be smaller than the maximum value for a given type  
		-	for base 10, t will stop at a multiple of 10, with the same number of digits as, say, int\_max  
		-	for base 16, the max for a given type is a multiple of 16 \(2^31^ or 2^32^ or 2^63^ or 2^64^\) minus one  
			-		so t will stop at \(n / t\) = 15  
  
For negative values \(pertains to ints\):  
	- the absolute value of a number is 0 \- n. The signedness of 0 is insignificant, but we will assume \(unsigned int\) 0 for clarity  
		-	binary 10000000000000000000000000000000 represents int\_min, but for uint it is the next number after int max  
		-	where a uint would set bits to 1 to add a number, signed ints also add the same number to int min in the same manner  
			-		i.e. \(int\_max \+ 1\) \+ 3 has the same binary form as int min \+ 3, but the latter has a different absolute value\!  
	- so, having the value \(\(unsigned int\) n\) on hand, where it should be less than \(int\_max \+ 1\) by the same amount that it is more than, just subtract the values\!  
		-	using \(unsigned int\) 0 acts as uint\_max \+ 1:  
			-		0 \- n = abs\(n\)  
			-		for n = int\_min, \(unsigned int\) n and 0 \- n are the same
