## Description  
  
This project takes a bitmap and displays it as a 3d wireframe in isometric projection.  
  
Bonus features include:  
	rotation  
	zoom  
	translation  
	changing to perspective projection  
	using multiple inputs at once (subject to user hardware)  
	changing colour where no colour is specified  
  
## Instructions  
  
make or make bonus, then pass in a bitmap file as an argument  
  
rotation controls (bonus feature):  
	q/e: yaw  
	w/s: pitch  
	a/d: roll  
	mouse wheel: zoom  
	arrow keys: translate  
	r, g, b: toggle colour bits  
  
## Resources  
  
[An introductory perspective on 3d graphics for those trying out this project](https://youtu.be/qjWkNZ0SXfo)  
This shows that trigonometry is all that stands between 2d and 3d projection. Of course, as the project demands an  
orthographic projection, we will not be dividing by z yet.  
  
[The formulas for said trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles)  
...but I dont understand math-

[even simpler matrix usage](https://youtu.be/XkY2DOUCWMU) << this shows what order to apply the matrix: in the opposite order that you would imagine.  
  
The above showcases how to use matrix formulas, from plugging them in to deriving them yourself. I personally wanted to go for zyx, but ended up with  
xyz due to my code implementation. That works well enough.

[mlx usage guide](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGT6G8aJHY/fqork5u1hxZONk8a4WQtdQ/view#1)  
  
The above mlx guide leaves out a few details:  
	function prototypes for other hook handlers  
	there needing to be only one handler per unique mask and/or event  
	configuration for keyrelease hook handler  
	the fact that I needed a loop hook handler  
	if you do not leave the first two digits in 0x00RRGGBB empty, you will be bitten in the rear end  
	using mlx-clear-img;  
  
Perplexity got me those details and my perspective formula: apparently anything can be a perspective scalar if you scale it with the right component.
