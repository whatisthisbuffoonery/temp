##Description  
  
Pipex aims to emulate file redirection as seen in the shell, taking zsh and bash for reference.  
You may recognise some of the symbols below:  
```
< in cmd1 | cmd2 > out
<< LIM cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 >> out
```  
Where in and out are files, and cmd1, cmd2, and cmd3 are shell commands.  
  
##Instructions  
  
To create the pipex program:  
`make`  
  
Usage:  
`./pipex in cmd1 cmd2 out`  
which performs:  
`< in cmd1 | cmd2 > out`  
  
Bonus features include chaining any number of commands, and using heredocs.  
To create the bonus version of pipex:  
`make bonus`  
  
Usage:  
`./pipex in cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 cmd4 ... cmdn out`  
  
Heredoc usage:  
`./pipex here_doc LIM cmd1 cmd2 ... cmdn out`  
which performs:  
`<< LIM cmd1 | cmd2 | ... | cmdn >> out`  
where LIM is any string of choice, which might be "a" for example.  
  
Note that the outfile contents are truncated when not using heredoc, and appended when using heredoc.

		handling quote parsing for single and double quotes are outside the scope of this project  
##Quote parsing for stuff like awk, tr, sed, etc.

It would be reasonable in a shell project where we handle quotes all by ourselves.  
  
This is not, in fact, a shell project. Our input string have all gone through bash's parsing.  
  
For instance:  
```
export
